  of the twentieth century. He is best remembered for making the argument that intuitive
  feelings often hold more weight than rational decision-making. In this incisive
  volume, fellow philosopher John Alexander Gunn presents an introduction to and thoughtful
  analysis of Bergson''s contributions.
